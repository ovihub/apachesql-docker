Please:
1 Check that MySQL is running on address remote.lotemarketting.com.au/pma
2 Check that MySQL is reachable on port 3306 (note: 3306 is the default, but this can be changed)
3 Check the user root has rights to connect to remote.lotemarketting.com.au/pma from your address (MySQL rights define what clients can connect to the server and from which machines) 
4 Make sure you are both providing a password if needed and using the correct password for remote.lotemarketting.com.au/pma connecting from the host address you're connecting from
